		<p>
			My name is Emilie and I currently study translation at Université Laval. I will obtain my diploma in April 2017. 
		</p>

		
		
		<p>
			I have been passionate about words and reading since my early childhood. I read all the time!
		</p>

		<p>
			I previously worked in a travel agency. I gained a lot of work experience in that field. I can work under pressure and respect tight deadlines and I am well-organized.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am looking forward to working with you!
